working on a little cljs app that parses your collection csv and tells you what percentage
of the total collection you've got so far

i want to be able to answer these questions:

* % total collection complete
* number of packs i've opened, measured in average-pack's-worth-of-spirit
* amount of spirit required to complete collection
* number of packs remaining to complete collection, measured in APWOS
* the above broken down per set (classic, battle pets, recent expasion)
* the above broken down per faction
* the above broken down per faction and set

there are two inputs we're dealing with:
1) the master list of cards, taken from listlyst
2) a particular player's collection CSV file, output from one of the duelyst client scripts

right now #1 is being fetched from an all_cards.json file i've included in resources/public;
i think that it would make more sense if i went ahead and converted that file to cljs
ahead of time.

matter of fact, i like that a lot. i'll do that now, i think it'll make reasoning about parsing
/ specs / etc more sane.


lol oh shit i think i don't even need the listlyst dump, whoops

i uh guess i should delete that file

actually nvm
the csv dump doesn't include which set the cards are in
so i think there's still some value in having both listlyst and the csv dump

ugh never mind, i asked in discord and t2k5 says he's going to release something that solves this
and i should really get back to self-driving car stuff
sooooo i am going to abandon this repo.

ok whatever i'm flying to san antonio and have nothing else to do

sticking with using both the csv dump and the listlyst dump
the latter has ids and card sets, and i like both of those

made a ton of progress just now.
right now we're seeing an interesting issue:
the csv dump sometimes looks like this:

"1","Keeper of the Vale","Neutral","Legendary","false","900","350"
"1","Keeper of the Vale","Neutral","Legendary","false","900","350"
"0","Keeper of the Vale","Neutral","Legendary","true","1800","900"
"0","Keeper of the Vale","Neutral","Legendary","true","1800","900"

whereas usually it looks like this:

"3","Jaxi","Neutral","Common","false","40","10"
"0","Jaxi","Neutral","Common","true","200","40"

put another way, each card usually has two lines in the csv, but some of them have four.
i think that this is because of card skins - keeper of the vale has a promotional skin
that i have a copy of, etc.

right now my code expects each card to always have two lines, so it does a
(partition 2 parsed-lines), but that's obviously not robust enough.
what i really want to do is take the list of parsed lines and turn it into a map of
{name -> list of parsed cards with name}
but i'm on an airplane and can't google for how to do that, and i don't remember
any core function that does that. i feel like there must be one though

can't figure out what to google, maybe there's no such function. writing one.

ok nice whatever it was easy to do with reduce

so now we've got the ability to say: these are the cards that you're missing, and how many
of each you're missing!

so i think it's about time we figure out how we actually want to display all this information.

copy-pasting from day 1 entry:

* % total collection complete
* number of packs i've opened, measured in average-pack's-worth-of-spirit
* amount of spirit required to complete collection
* number of packs remaining to complete collection, measured in APWOS
* the above broken down per set (classic, battle pets, recent expasion)
* the above broken down per faction
* the above broken down per faction and set

i also want a progress bar.
let's start with % total collection complete, and figure out how to render a progress bar of that

ok some time has passed
here's my rough idea of how to display this information
overall completion progress bar on top
then a series of horizontal sections, one for each faction (and neutral)
each section looks like this:
progress bar for section completion
list of missing cards:
  * in order by mana cost ascending
  * color of card name denotes its rarity
  * card set denoted by an icon or letter

undecided on what the actual string should say. examples:
(2) [B] Foo of Bar: 1

where (2) means mana cost 2, and 1 means you're missing 1 of these, and [B] means Basic
basically anything along these lines should do the trick, we'll see if i can think of anything
better but i think that's a fine start

gonna try to figure out how to have pretty progress bars real quick

i'm seeing some weird fuckin behavior
.html isn't cleanly importing .collection
maybe .collection is a bad name?
as far as i can tell, in js-land, duelyst_collection.collection is out of date
it somehow knows about a "completion_percentage" fn that no longer exists
and doesn't know about card-completion-percentage, etc
maybe a compile error of some sort?
eh i bet i should just restart chrome. let's try that.

no, issue persists
ah, shift-refresh fixes it.
nice.

ugh.
