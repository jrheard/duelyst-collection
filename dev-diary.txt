working on a little cljs app that parses your collection csv and tells you what percentage
of the total collection you've got so far

i want to be able to answer these questions:

* % total collection complete
* number of packs i've opened, measured in average-pack's-worth-of-spirit
* amount of spirit required to complete collection
* number of packs remaining to complete collection, measured in APWOS
* the above broken down per set (classic, battle pets, recent expasion)
* the above broken down per faction
* the above broken down per faction and set

there are two inputs we're dealing with:
1) the master list of cards, taken from listlyst
2) a particular player's collection CSV file, output from one of the duelyst client scripts

right now #1 is being fetched from an all_cards.json file i've included in resources/public;
i think that it would make more sense if i went ahead and converted that file to cljs
ahead of time.

matter of fact, i like that a lot. i'll do that now, i think it'll make reasoning about parsing
/ specs / etc more sane.


lol oh shit i think i don't even need the listlyst dump, whoops

i uh guess i should delete that file
